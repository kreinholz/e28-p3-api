            <p><a href='https: //www.amazon.com/I-M-Artificial-Intelligence-Enhanced-Exploration-ebook/dp/B07YQC9V62' target=_blank>A.I.M.E.E. Amazon Link</a></p>
            <p>I tried something new this time (aside from designing the cover completely on my own--yes there's a hidden message encoded in binary for those humans, or machines, who can translate it!)--Kindle MatchBook, a program that allows purchasers of the print/paperback edition to purchase a Kindle eBook edition free of charge. (Normal prices are $15 for the paperback and $2.99 for the eBook).</p>
            <p>The story deals with space exploration, contact with an extraterrestrial civilization, and especially Artificial Intelligence!--but it also asks a lot of philosophical and theological questions about belief, unbelief, the nature of consciousness and humanity, and whether a machine can ever be \"alive\". It also features a Muslim hero and seeks to counter the toxic and blatantly false Islamophobic narrative often peddled in the West.</p>
            <p>I hope there's something in this story for everyone, and I tremendously enjoyed writing it. I hope you enjoy reading it!</p>",

            "content": "<p>I think I've come up with my \"final\" blurb for <u>A.I.M.E.E.</u>, my first Science Fiction novel. Here goes:</p>
            <p>It's 2647, or 144 as humans count time in the Interstellar Colonization Era. Ray Harris is a man with no attachments. The son of poor Martian parents, Ray made his escape freelancing as an interstellar star ship pilot, taking exploration and salvage missions others didn't want. The problem is, he's wasting away from a pair of chronic illnesses. There's a treatment, but only the super-rich can afford it. Ray figures he has one good mission left in him before his health forces him into early retirement and hospice care.</p>
            <p>Aimee Sultan is a deeply religious woman living in an age of skepticism. She's also the first sentient machine in the history of humanity. She was 'born' in 2396, when humanity launched the most ambitious interstellar mission in its history: IE32, a generation star ship bound for the one place beyond earth that might harbor life. However, just before Aimee and her human family reached their destination 44 light years from earth, they vanished without a trace. Multiple follow-up missions to investigate IE32's disappearance likewise vanished, in what's become known as the Bermuda Triangle in Space.</p>
            <p>Stranded on a distant planet, Aimee wonders if humanity will ever learn her story, or if we'll even accept herâ€”AI is highly feared and regulated, and 'living' machines like Aimee aren't supposed to exist. Meanwhile, Ray's last mission puts him directly into harm's way, and on a collision course with Aimee's last known destination, where something waits that could threaten the survival of all humanity.</p>",

            "content": "<p>So, this summer, after a fairly strenuous Spring 2019 semester at Harvard Extension School, I thought I'd ease back and take it easy before resuming my Computer Science studies in the Fall.</p>
            <p>So much for that, I ended up taking a very interesting (but challenging) Machine Learning class through Coursera. I finished it last month. I won't go into depth about the topic, but it opened up a whole new world of Linear Algebra and vectorized solutions to Computer Science challenges in place of simple \"for\" loops. I'm looking forward to optimizing some of my old (and new) code with the help of Linear Algebra libraries wherever possible!</p>            
            <p>I've changed my Fall study plans a bit. Now, I'm hoping to get into CSCI E-14A, Building Interactive Web Applications for Data Analysis, because it uses Python and involves incorporating Machine Learning algorithms into web applications. Perfect follow-up to what I studied this summer! Then, next Spring (2020) I want to take CSCI E-39, Modular Design Patterns with React, because, well, I've been exposed to both Vue and Angular in previous HES classes, and I've been learning React through Udemy and like it a lot! I think React will become my JavaScript front-end library of choice, in fact, largely replacing the use of HTML templating engines.</p>     
            <p>I'm still proofreading/editing \"A.I.M.E.E.,\" my latest novel, and am currently on version 3. I've incorporated some Machine Learning language into the book based on my recent studies, which I hope will enhance the realism a bit. I've also decided to take the plunge into hiring a sensitivity reader to proofread my manuscript, as I wrote the book outside of my own cultural and religious background (an enormously rewarding, albeit challenging, thing to do), and I want to ensure I \"get it right.\" So \"A.I.M.E.E.\" won't be rushed to publication, but my hope is a better end product that I can really be proud of.</p>            
            <p>Lastly, I unexpectedly got a job offer! I've now been back to work for 2 weeks, doing a full time job as a Human Resources Specialist. Not my target career of web/software development, but a completely unplanned yet very welcome opportunity. It's a \"term\" position that only lasts until October, after which I don't know what will happen, but it's nice to earn a paycheck again after retiring from my Air Force career last year. My doctors are also starting to make some headway into finally cracking the enigma of my medical issues, although I'm trying to temper my expectations and not get my hopes up too much. So far, they've found lots of autoimmunity, which I think can account for most of my symptoms. So, with the right treatment, I may regain some functionality and reduce my pain levels. That seems like almost too much to hope for, so again I'm tempering my expectations, but I'm cautiously optimistic that my health will improve in the future, or that I'll at least know \"what\" is wrong with my body.</p>            
            <p>And with that, dear friends, have a wonderful remainder of your summer (or winter, if you're in the Southern Hemisphere!), and I'll be sure to post about any future publications, either in the software arena (I have several ideas I'd like to write and push to Github) or in creative writing (namely, \"A.I.M.E.E.,\" although I've always got a story idea or two floating around in my head).</p>",

            "content": "<p>I haven't posted in a while, and the reason for that is simple: my days have been consumed with Computer Science coursework! This semester, I'm taking 2 Master's level classes, for a total of 8 graduate credits, through Harvard Extension School. I'm not going to lie...it's grueling.</p>
            <p>The above screenshot, which is rather tongue-in-cheek, is from a test I did of a chat application I wrote using Flask-SocketIO and JavaScript. I had temporarily opened up my development server to my home network, and connected to it with my trusty iPhone. (Hence \"mobile kev\", on the iPhone, chatting with \"Kevin\" on my Desktop computer). And my \"monologue\" with myself is accurate--I do hate CSS, but I'm determined to learn to like it, or at least to get along with it. ðŸ˜‰</p>            
            <p>This semester I'm studying the MEAN Stack--MongoDB (and the Mongoose Node.js module), Express, Angular, and Node--in one class...and Python3, Flask, Django, SQLite3, and PostgreSQL--in the other.</p>            
            <p>Node.js and the 2 Python web server options I'm working with, Flask and Django, are very different, with Node being pretty agnostic about everything, and extremely modular, and either Python option being extremely opinionated and taking a lot of server-side design decisions out of my hands. I think the initial learning curve to set up a functioning web server with Node (and Express! I wouldn't want to set up a Node server without all of the goodies Express brings into the equation) is higher than doing the same thing with Flask, but in the long run Node offers far more flexibility. And, with a Node-based web server, you've got JavaScript running server-side, and JavaScript running client-side: seems like an easier move between front-end, back-end, and full-stack web development. That having been said, Python is a pretty cool programming language in its own right, and I'm glad to have gotten exposure to it!</p>            
            <p>The server frameworks and the programming languages they're written in are only part of the puzzle, though, because of course then you add in templating engines to dynamically generate web pages (it's 2019, who serves static HTML pages anymore? Really!), and that's another bit to learn. Flask forces Jinja2 on the user, which is itself based on (but different from) Django's built-in templating engine. For continuity's sake (and because I've grown to like it), I found a JavaScript port of Jinja2, Nunjucks, that I've been using on my Node-based web apps.</p>            
            <p>Then there are the databases! SQL databases in their various flavors were just about the only way I conceived of \"data\"...until I was introduced to MongoDB, a NoSQL database. Why is it called \"NoSQL\"? Well, unlike SQLite3 and PostgreSQL, which organize data into tables, with increasingly complex relationships with other tables, and more and more \"foreign keys\" to tie them together the bigger your app grows, MongoDB looks like, well, JSON, which is safe and familiar to any web developer. Even writing web apps in Python, I still use JSON for my API routes to easily exchange data with client-side JavaScript. A NoSQL database doesn't divide data into tables with their relationships and foreign keys. No, it lets you structure your data pretty much however you want, and since JSON is such a fact of life on the web, its queries look a lot more intuitive and easier to understand than SQL queries. (MongoDB doesn't actually use JSON, it uses BSON, but syntactically it looks very much like JSON).</p>            
            <p>All this is to say, I've been really busy with my studies! The good news is, I'm learning a lot, and I enjoy it! I've always liked computers and technology, but \"looking under the hood\" of so many web technologies has been enlightening and fun. Hopefully it'll even lead to a new career writing software and making cool apps! Probably for the web at first, but I may move into mobile or even Desktop app writing in the future...why not?</p>            
            <p>So that's what I've been up to. If you don't hear from me for a while, trust that my nose is buried inside of a code editor, and I'm writing some application or other in either JavaScript, Python, or a combination of both!</p>",

Ha! Vue is way more complex, and cooler, that I could've imagined at the time. It's also a lot more similar to Angular than I could've known. It's a robust, complete front-end framework, and though its market share might lag behind React and Angular, it's every bit as capable. I'm glad I took a course on it!",

I'll have worked with Node.js and Python-based servers, as well as modern PHP, in additional to client-side JavaScript technologies, to include the popular frameworks Vue and Angular.",
